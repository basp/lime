    <h3>Lime (it's alive)</h3>
    <div><p>A few weeks ago I got rid of my WordPress install and replaced it with Dropplets. I tried to accomplish two things with this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make it easier to write and publish posts</li>
<li>Make it faster</li>
</ol>

<p>Writing and publishing posts is now a lot easier than it was before but unfortunately my site is still not very fast. In fact, it feels quite sluggish. </p>

<p>Then I ran into Jekyll via another project and this got my attention - why not generate the site statically? This should definately make it somewhat faster. I don&rsquo;t like Ruby that much though and needed another pet project for Go so Lime was born.</p>

<p>Lime is a lot like Jekyll only not as fancy. Also, it is a single self-contained executable and it&rsquo;s very fast.</p>
